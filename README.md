Ekklesia
Ekklesia is a social app designed to bring together Christian-based organizations, communities, and individual members in a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment. Unlike traditional social media platforms, Ekklesia emphasizes structured engagement within validated communities and organizations (churches, only those known to be doctrinally correct).
 Core Concept
Ekklesia allows:
Organizations and Communities to create accounts and bring members together in a structured environment.


Individuals to join as personal members, creating accounts only if they belong to a registered organization or community within the app.


 Main Features
Membership Validation
New personal accounts can only be created if they are validated as members of an existing organization or community.


Verified members can also start their own communities or organizations within Ekklesia.


Public and Private Content
Members, organizations, and communities can share posts publicly (visible to all users) or privately (visible only to verified members within the app).


 Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration
Sofia Section
A dedicated space for sharing books, writing articles, and conducting collaborative research.


Users can create "Contribution Basins," allowing others to contribute to ongoing research projects.


Exhibition Section
A showcase for users to present products, ideas, talents, and promote specific projects.


Supports 5-30 second short video descriptions with links to full content.


ü§ù Community Growth and Interaction
Registered members have the autonomy to create new communities or organizations, fostering active engagement.


Communities can discuss topics, collaborate on projects, and share updates that benefit their members.


Unique Positioning
Ekklesia stands out by combining the traditional aspects of social networks with features that support organized communities, making it ideal for structured knowledge sharing and collaborative growth.
It is a blend of social media, community-building, and educational collaboration tools, designed for those seeking more purposeful and organized online interactions.
